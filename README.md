# FraudulentClaimDetection
> Global Insure, a major player in the insurance industry, is experiencing substantial financial losses due to a high volume of fraudulent claims. The existing fraud detection system relies heavily on manual inspections, which are not only time-consuming and labour-intensive but also inefficient. As a result, many fraudulent claims are detected only after payouts have been made, limiting the company's ability to prevent losses and straining operational resources.

## General Information
- Problem Statement
	-  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Global Insure, a major player in the insurance industry, is experiencing substantial financial losses due to a high volume of fraudulent claims. The existing fraud detection system relies heavily on manual inspections, which are not only time-consuming and labour-intensive but also inefficient. As a result, many fraudulent claims are detected only after payouts have been made, limiting the company's ability to prevent losses and straining operational resources.


- Data Set
	- insurance_claims set was considered which has all the attributes contributing to the fraudulent insurance claims 
	 
- Approach for analysis
1. Data Preparation and Cleaning	
	- This step involves handling missing , datatypes

2. EDA
	- This step involves reading and understanding the dataset via Visualization

3. Feature Engineering
	- This part focuses on selecting and creating the relevant set of features for Model
   
4. Model Building
	- This part focuses on building model Logistic Regression and Random Forest Models.

5. Predictions and Model Evaluation
	- Model Predictions with Test Set and Evaluation.
